# Unnamed Spy Game

### Players: 2-5
### Time: God knows

## Goal

There are two victory conditions:

1. Amass 10 Spy points by completing Tasks.
2. Be the last spy standing.

## Turn

On a turn, a character may choose to do one of the following things:

* **Move** one character up to three squares.
* **Move** two characters one square each.
* Request a new **Task**.
* **Accuse** a player.

## Movement

Movement can be in any cardinal direction (no diagonal movement is allowed).

If a move ends with a character adjacent to some creature or object, they can **Interact** with that object.

*Side-note: A move of 0 squares is allowed, in order to interact with something that the character is already next to.*

### Interactions

Interaction can be of any form - looking at something, talking to someone, et cetera. Any action involving something else on the board is an Interaction.

*Side-note: A talking to B is NOT the same thing as B talking to A. If spy A is tasked with talking to Character B, then A needs to Interact with B.*

## Tasks and spy points

Completing Tasks is the only way to gain Spy points. Some Tasks are easy and some are harder; the harder the task, the more points are available for its completion.

On your turn you may request a new Task. You can have up to 2 Tasks in play at one time. If gaining a new Task sets you to 3, then you must discard one (which can be the one you just drew).

You gain the points for completion as soon as a Task is completed. If completing a task puts you above 10 points, then you win the game.

## Accusations

An accusation is the most powerful move a player can take - but it comes with extreme risk. If you are confident that you have identified the character of a player, then you can Accuse that player of being the character. Doing this will immediately end the game - for one of you.

If you are correct in your Accusation, that player is knocked out of the game. If you are incorrect, you are knocked out of the game. *If you are knocked out by incorrect accusation, do NOT reveal your character!*
